# Potential IT Risks for TSMC (Based on Recent Public Information)

**Cybersecurity Threats and Attacks:** TSMC faces relentless external cyber threats ranging from criminal ransomware attacks to state-sponsored espionage. In mid-2023, the LockBit ransomware gang listed TSMC on its dark web leak site and demanded a $70 million ransom after gaining access to some data via a breached IT supplier ([www.csoonline.com](https://www.csoonline.com/article/644440/hit-with-70m-ransom-demand-tsmc-pins-lockbit-hack-on-breached-supplier.html#:~:text=Taiwan,party%20breach)). TSMC stated that its own operations weren’t directly hacked in that incident ([www.csoonline.com](https://www.csoonline.com/article/644440/hit-with-70m-ransom-demand-tsmc-pins-lockbit-hack-on-breached-supplier.html#:~:text=with%20leading%20technology%20players%20like,great%20example%20of%20why%20machine)), but the case underscored the risk of attackers stealing sensitive information and attempting extortion. At the same time, advanced persistent threat (APT) groups aligned with nation-states have intensified cyber-espionage campaigns against Taiwan’s semiconductor industry (including big firms like TSMC) ([www.straitstimes.com](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-linked-hackers-target-taiwans-chip-industry-with-increasing-attacks-researchers-say#:~:text=hackers%20are%20targeting%20the%20Taiwanese,linked%20groups)). For example, researchers found that Chinese-linked hackers have used *TSMC-themed* phishing lures to deliver malware (like Cobalt Strike beacons) for spying on semiconductor companies ([thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com/2023/10/chinese-hackers-target-semiconductor.html#:~:text=Chinese%20Hackers%20Target%20Semiconductor%20Firms,have%20utilized%20a%20previously%20undocumented)). These examples show that TSMC must contend with both financially motivated cybercriminals (e.g. ransomware syndicates) and sophisticated state-backed hackers trying to infiltrate its networks, steal data, or disrupt operations. 

**Third-Party and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:** TSMC’s reliance on a broad ecosystem of suppliers and partners introduces **supply chain IT risks**. A security weakness in any third-party provider’s systems can become an entry point into TSMC’s information environment. This was evident in the 2023 LockBit incident, where a breach **originated via a vulnerability in a third-party vendor’s system** that had access to TSMC’s network ([www.grcreport.com](https://www.grcreport.com/post/tsmc-data-breach-traced-back-to-third-party-vendor-highlighting-the-importance-of-supply-chain-security#:~:text=foundry%2C%20suffered%20a%20data%20breach,external%20partners%20to%20support%20their)). Attackers exploited the supplier’s weakness to penetrate and **exfiltrate data**, essentially using the contractor as a backdoor into TSMC ([www.grcreport.com](https://www.grcreport.com/post/tsmc-data-breach-traced-back-to-third-party-vendor-highlighting-the-importance-of-supply-chain-security#:~:text=vulnerability%20in%20the%20systems%20of,external%20partners%20to%20support%20their)). TSMC had to cut off data exchange with the affected supplier, highlighting the need for rigorous vendor security standards. This scenario demonstrates how third-party IT products or services (such as equipment software, integration partners, or cloud providers) can pose risks — if a partner is compromised, it can **leak confidential information or open paths into TSMC’s own systems**. Ensuring strong cybersecurity measures throughout the supply chain (vendor assessments, strict access controls, compliance checks, etc.) is therefore critical to reduce this risk. 

**Insider Threats and Intellectual Property Leaks:** Risks aren’t only external; insiders with privileged access can also endanger TSMC’s information assets. **Insider threats** include employees or contractors who might misuse their access to steal or leak confidential data, whether for personal gain or under coercion. In fact, TSMC disclosed in 2025 that it had detected *“unauthorized activities”* by certain personnel which suggested **potential trade secret leaks**, leading the company to take disciplinary and legal action ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/chipmaker-tsmc-says-it-has-discovered-potential-trade-secret-leaks.html#:~:text=monitoring%20mechanisms%2C,a%20treasure%20trove%20of%20intellectual)). Reports indicated that several engineers (now former employees) allegedly attempted to siphon off proprietary information about TSMC’s cutting-edge 2-nanometer chip process while still employed ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/chipmaker-tsmc-says-it-has-discovered-potential-trade-secret-leaks.html#:~:text=matter%2C%20reported%20on%20Tuesday%20that,a%20treasure%20trove%20of%20intellectual)). TSMC maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward such breaches and swiftly removed the individuals involved. This incident highlights the constant risk of **intellectual property (IP) theft from within** – especially given TSMC’s position at the technological forefront, its process and design data are extremely valuable. (Notably, this is not a new concern: in 2018 a TSMC ex-employee was indicted for stealing 28nm process secrets for a Chinese company ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/chipmaker-tsmc-says-it-has-discovered-potential-trade-secret-leaks.html#:~:text=200%2C000%20trade%20secrets%20recorded%20in,2023%2C%20ASML%2C%20which%20makes%20machines)), showing that IP theft has long been a serious threat.) Robust internal controls, monitoring, and employee training are necessary to mitigate insider risks, as even one breach of critical trade secrets could erode TSMC’s competitive edge.

**IT System Outages and Operational Disruptions:** Another major category of IT risk is the possibility of **system failures or malware outbreaks** that disrupt production. Semiconductor manufacturing is highly automated and heavily reliant on IT systems (for equipment control, logistics, etc.), so any significant IT downtime can halt operations and result in substantial losses. A stark example occurred a few years ago when a malware infection hit TSMC’s fab facilities: in August 2018, a variant of the WannaCry ransomware worm found its way into TSMC’s network (reportedly after a supplier installed tainted software without a proper virus scan) ([thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/tsmc-wannacry-ransomware-attack.html#:~:text=semiconductor%20manufacturer%2C%20its%20computer%20systems,TSMC%20CEO)). The virus spread to thousands of machines and forced several chip fabrication plants to shut down for at least a day, delaying production. TSMC later revealed the incident ended up costing on the order of **tens of millions of dollars** in lost revenue and recovery costs ([www.manufacturingdive.com](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/semiconductor-cybersecurity-tsmc-semi-consortium/753133/#:~:text=confidence,%E2%80%9D)). This case, though slightly older, underscores how an IT incident — whether caused by malware, human error, or equipment software bugs — can translate directly into operational and financial risk. In the past year, TSMC and the wider industry have bolstered safeguards (like network segmentation, rigorous scanning of new equipment, and business continuity planning) to prevent such disruptions. Nonetheless, **operational IT risks** remain: a serious network outage, cyber attack on production tools, or critical software failure could interrupt manufacturing, delay chip deliveries, and harm customer trust. TSMC must continually stress-test its IT infrastructure and incident response plans to ensure that downtime risks are minimized and managed.
